## CitiBike in New York City
CitiBike has been a successful business in NY city. 

Bike stations are dispersed throughout the city, including the adjacent cities. Certain stations show more frequent usage compared to others. This could be due to the stations' vicinity to companies, tourist sites, etc. 

In August 2019, CitiBike usage in NY city was higher Thursday to Saturday, compared to other days of the week. This is possibly due to 1) the influx of tourists during the summer months and 2) increase of outdoor activities towards the end of week. 

## CitiBike business in Des Moines
The following are some analyses done for Des Moines prior to considering opening CitiBike in Des Moines. 

### Comparison between Des Moines and NY city
The overall comparison between Des Moines and NY city was done by analyzing the US Census data (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219). Des Moines is obviously a smaller city compared to NY city. The size of the city is less than 25% of NY city. At the same time, population is estimated to be 40 times less than NY city. Thus, the population density in Des Moines is 10 times less than NY city.

The gender data does not show much difference between the two cities. 

Taking into consideration of the above analyses, Des Moines requires less number of stations and bikes compared to NY city, which means less upfront cost in starting the business and less maintenance cost in Des Moines.

### Bike usage research
Des Moines and NY city has similar age distributions. As shown in the CitiBike usage data in NY city, the main usage happens within the 19-64 years age group. As the two cities do not differ mainly in age group proportions, we can expect there will be similar amount of interest levels in Des Moines.
